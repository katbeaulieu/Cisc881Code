# Cisc881Code
To run the first part of this project you run the code in file surface_normal_check_for_scene.m. The data for this project was too large to add to github so is stored at onedrive. The link is https://1drv.ms/f/s!Aq5tLzf4ljV5lw9Hn0Lm4ATjA_dX. The link is also provided in the submission comments.

To run the second part of this project you run the code for approx_center_point.m. Again the .nrrd files in each patient folder, found on onedrive is used as the input data for this program.
